# Corewar

Corewar is a simple assembly game where simple progams fight for  
control of a virtual machine.  
Warriors are programmed in a 16 instruction assembler language that is
compiled to bytecode and run on a VM with a cycilic memory space.  
Each Warrior must attempt to spead their code while defending from enemies  
that are attempting to do the same.
